Limitation of Hive:-
------------------
There is no key (Primary Forign key) system in Hive.
THere is no sub queries process  in  hive 
there is no insert no update no delete min hive (note this if we are doing from table to table then it is possible)
there is no data size declaration in hive (means varchar(90) or something like this )
it is mainly for Structure  data processing  only.

Data Types in hadoop (hive, pig , java , Mapreduce):- 
--------------------------------------------------

Java		Mapreduce			Pig				Hive 
byte		byteWritable		byte			byte
int			intWritable			int				int 
long		longWritable		long			long
double		doubleWritable		double			double 
float		floatWritable		float			float
boolean	    booleanWritable 	booleanArray	boolean
char		text			    charArray	    String
String      text				charArray		String			

	
purpus of hive :-
--------------------------------------------------
To provide simple interface to developers and to avoid java coding 

it provids the sql like queary facility to process or anylyse the data, called as Hive query language.
(HQL)
Internaly hive engine convrts the each query in to map reduce programe .
this is Db migration into hadoop

Hive Flow :-
---------
(hive Queary)--->(hiveMetaStore)---->MRProgram---->run against multiple datanodes.

Diffrence between Hive and Pig:-
------------------------------
Pig is Yahoo product, where as hive is apache product 
Both have license and integration free.
Pig data storage as object format, whereas hive store as file formate.
Pig use latin language to execute data processing, whereas hive use HQL.
Pig can store Structure and unstructure data, whereas hive mainly store Structure data only.
Implementation of pig is for web log processing, where as hive uses to perform defferent-1 type of analysis on data.
Pig storage is only temp storage, but Hive storage is permanent/temporary storage.

Running/execution mode for pig and Hive:-
---------------------------------------

Hive:-
----
There is 2 mode.
1. Local Mode(query by query execution)
2. Batch Mode(Keeping all related query in one file as .hql file and execute)

To execute batch mode command:-
----------------------------- 
(Hive):- source file_name.hql

Pig:-
---
In pig batch mode(keeping all the related script in one file as .pig)

To Execute batch mode in pig command:-
(pig) :- exe filename.pig
